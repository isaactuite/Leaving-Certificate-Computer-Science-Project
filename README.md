# Leaving Cert Computer Science Project (Health Monitor)
My H1 project for Leaving Certificate Computer Science. 

For this project, I was tasked to use an embedded system to improve the wellbeing of a specific demographic. I designed this project for individuals who suffer from sleep apnea to monitor their symptoms throughout the night. My device constantly monitors the user's heartrate and blood oxygen levels, and provides critical medical advice based on the readings.

For the data analysis part of the project, (Advanced Requirements), I analysed a database of over 9000 patients from a long term clinical study. The study observed the symptoms of sleep apnea sufferers and took note of various factors such as amount of arousals from sleep per night, average blood oxygen saturation, and average heartrate. I then created a model using Python to examine the relationship between these variables. I was then able to predict a change in one variable using a change in another. 

Overall, this project achieved a H1 mark within a very harsh Leaving Cert marking system. There is attatched a comprehensive report (titled "index"), and a video to demostrate how the end project works and how it meets the requirements set out in the brief. I used Python and C++, with libraries such as Pandas, MatPlotLib, Scikit-learn, and NumPy
